# Project 4: PouchKotato

## Introduction:

PouchKotato allows you to track your favorite TV Shows. You simply add shows to your list and get back information like current season, current episode, next episode date & time, and more.

### Technologies Used:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
 * Materialize
3. JavaScript
 * Angular.js
 * Node.js
 * Express.js
 * jQuery
 * Express Modules:
 * Morgan
 * Body-Parser
 * Mongoose
 
4. MongoDB

### Approach:

The idea was to employ a combination of Angular.JS and CSS Frameworks on the front end and make use of MongoDB for CRUD operations.

#### The site allows users to:
1. Search for and add TV Shows to their personal lists
2. Retrieve pertinent information about their favorite TV Shows
